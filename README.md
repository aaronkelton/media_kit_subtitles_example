# media_kit_captions

Testing media kit subtitles in a barebones project.

I am expecting subtitles to be displayed by default, but they do not.

## Is the media link faulty?

When I visit https://cdmdemo.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15700coll2/custom/subtitles, I can see that the web player has a toggle to show/hide captions.

But when I visit the video url address itself, the Chrome web video player does NOT show any option to toggle captions. So this makes me believe that the video address url does not sufficiently supply the captions.
